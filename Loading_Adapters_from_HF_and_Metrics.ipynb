This confirms that Reddit is very opinionated as well. For this chatbot, this is what I wanted since I wanted something fun. What's surprising to me is how well it was able to learn even with a very small number of examples. I also tried training it with fewer examples (almost half of what I used for the final version), and I was able to get very good results as well. It got me thinking that we can use this method for efficient fine-tuning even in situations where we can gather data manually. It could even be used on Minerva Forum data to learn how professors grade. We could even add Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG) to give the model a database of specialized knowledge of some Minerva materials and it can grade students for us :))"

A score of 0 means there is no overlap (no matching n-grams) between the generated text and any of the reference texts, while a score of 100 indicates a perfect match.
