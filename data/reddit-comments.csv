"Bought my first contract today, $SPX 3/16 $2700 CALL BABY. We're going to rebound right back up, trust my beginners luck. Options are pretty simple, just read some shit then buy one and observe it.

"Wb what i said below about buying dips of companies that get bad news coverage, like when intel got the bad rap for backdoors in chips, sent down 4 % before earnings then shot 10% after. Should i be buying those opportunities ?","Good companies that will almost always recover - sure buy the dip (e.g. coca-cola, etc.). You can also do this with index funds, like SPY. Averaging down is actually a pretty good strategy for index funds, as they'll over a long enough timeline always grow. \n  \n Almost any other company DO NOT buy the dip just because of bad news coverage thinking they'll automatically go up. Take a look at enron."
"There probably is because then America is one heart attack away from a 3 term president","Nope 22nd amendment actually stipulates very clearly that it prohibits the election of a candidate for the 3rd time. \n  \n Edit (for clarity): It prohibits the *election* of a candidate for the 3rd time not the actual 'holding the office' for a 3rd time. Hence there isn't a clause preventing a former president serving as VP, thus becoming president in the heart attack scenario mentioned above."
